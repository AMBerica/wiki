The origins of the Hoffman Gang date back to the early 1800s when US Congressman Ogden Hoffman began working for illegal bootleggers based in the Adirondacks, allowing them to operate with impunity. In the early 1900s dyring Prohibition, the Hoffman Gang was proported to have over 100 Congressman and nearly 30 Senators on their payroll.

## Leadership

Leadership has been passed down through generations, usually to the first son. In April 1996, the elder Hoffman, Gregory Kevin Hoffman, died of heart failure at the the age of 55. Leadership was initially assumed by his brother, Jerome Elliton Hoffman, because the eldest son of the elder Hoffman was only 27 years old and considered too young to assume the reins. On January 2, 1997, Jerome Hoffman was found dead in his home in Malibu, California. Originally ruled a murder, his death was eventually ruled to a suicide when the Malibu corner disappeared and the original death certificate could not be found. The eldest son, Kevin Jerome Hoffman, assumed leadership of the originzation and has served in this role since.

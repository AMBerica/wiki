# Hoffman Gang

The Hoffman Gang is an American criminal syndicate. Considered to be the "most the intrusive and legally connected crime organization operating in America", the operation has expanded beyond drug trafficking and runs a profitable cyber crime operation and gun running rackets.

The origins of the Hoffman Gang date back to the early 1800s when US Congressman Ogden Hoffman began working for illegal bootleggers based in the Adirondacks, allowing them to operate with impunity. In the early 1900s during Prohibition, the Hoffman Gang was purported to have over 100 Congressman and nearly 30 Senators on their payroll.

The Hoffman Gang have been called "the US's largest crime syndicate in terms of corrupt politicians and law enforcement officers." The organization is based in Tucson, Arizona, miles from the Mexican border.

### Leadership

Leadership has been passed down through generations, usually to the first son. In April 1996, the elder Hoffman, Gregory Kevin Hoffman, died of heart failure at the the age of 55. Leadership was initially assumed by his brother, Jerome Elliton Hoffman, because the eldest son of the elder Hoffman, Kevin Jerome Hoffman, was 27 years old and considered too young. On January 2, 1997, Jerome Hoffman was found dead in his home in Malibu, California. Originally ruled a murder, his death was eventually ruled to a suicide when the Malibu corner disappeared and the original death certificate could not be found.

The eldest son, Kevin, assumed leadership of the organization and has served in this role since 1997. Longtime family friend, Jack Schechtman, joined the organization in 2009 and is currently second in command, as the "strong arm" of the cartel.

### Operations

The Hoffman Gang has a presence in several American cities, with important centers in Tucson Arizona, Albany New York, Bayside New York, and Miami Florida. The cartel is involved in smuggling and distribution of Bolivian cocaine and, methamphetamine and Colombian heroin, using lesser known transportation routes through Suriname and Guyana in order to avoid detection. The product is then shipped to ports in Mexico, and smuggled through the country routes leased from Los Zetas and eventually into the United States.

Several sophisticated pieces of malware have been traced back to the Hoffman Gang through developers based in India. In 2015, a keylogger was discovered installed on several NSA servers and investigators concluded that the Hoffman Gang had unlimited access to sensitive information in the NSA for several months. The extent of the information that was compromised is still unknown.

In 2016, it was reported that the Hoffman Gang makes over $1.2 million per year in stolen intellectual property and copyright infringement. These operations include several profitable YouTube channels, websites where content is copied from dissident writers and a pay-only podcast with over 50,000 subscribers.

#### Political Corruption

The extent of the cartel's government influence is unknown. Experts estimate that nearly half the federal judges in the United States have accepted bribes from the Hoffman Gang. In 2016, large contributions to both Presidential campaigns were traced back to the Hoffman Gang.

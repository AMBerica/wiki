### `alt-accounts`, `alt`, `alts`

Some people like to have alternative accounts from which to post. Some times these are well known alts of extablished users and some times the *real* user will pretend the alt is an entirely different person. 

Alts are not allowed to run or vote for [President or Vice-President](elections.md).

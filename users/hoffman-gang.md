# Hoffman Gang

## Introduction

The Hoffman Gang is an American criminal syndicate. Considered to be the "most the intrusive and legally connected crime organization operating in America", the operation has expanded beyond drug trafficking and runs a profitable cyber crime operation and gun running rackets. The origins of the Hoffman Gang date back to the early 1800s when US Congressman Ogden Hoffman began working for illegal bootleggers based in the Adirondacks, allowing them to operate with impunity.

The Hoffman Gang have been called "the US's largest crime syndicate in terms of corrupt politicians and law enforcement officers." The orignization is based in Tucson, Arizona, miles from the Mexican border.
